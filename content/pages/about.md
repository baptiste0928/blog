Welcome to my blog! I'm Baptiste, also known as *baptiste0928*.

I actually study programming in France and learned many programming languages
in the last years during my spare time. I started with Python and learned
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) few years later (I almost only use this now).

In 2018, I created the [RaidProtect](https://raidprotect.org) Discord bot, which
is now [open-source](https://github.com/raidprotect/raidprotect). It is used by
thousands of servers each day and is one of the most popular Discord bots.

This blog is a personal blog where I write about my programming journey. If you
wish, you can subscribe to my [RSS feed](/atom.xml) to keep up to date with my
posts.

## Projects
In my spare time, I work on open-source projects. Here are some of them:

- [`raidprotect`](https://github.com/raidprotect/raidprotect): Discord bot
  focused on moderation and security, built in Rust using the
  [twilight](https://twilight.rs/) library ecosystem.

- [`rosetta`](https://github.com/baptiste0928/rosetta): Rust i18n library based
  on code generation.

- [`twilight-interactions`](https://github.com/baptiste0928/twilight-interactions):
  third-party twilight library to facilitate parsing of Discord slash commands.

- [`cargo-install`](https://github.com/baptiste0928/cargo-install): cache-efficient
  installation of Rust crates in GitHub Actions.

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/baptiste0928) to see all my open-source
repositories.
